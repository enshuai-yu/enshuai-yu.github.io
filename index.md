Welcome to my website! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/thought-leadership/divisions/accounting-information-systems">Accounting and Information System Division</a> of The University of British Columbia. Prior to joining UBC, I obtained my Bachelor in Economics from <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn/">Wuhan University</a> and Master of Finance from <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/">MIT Sloan School of Management</a>.
 
My research interest lies at the intersection of management accounting, ESG, and supply chain management. I explore how firms shape their global sourcing decisions, specifically in response to the use of climate-linked metrics in executive compensation and the ethnic diversity in boardrooms. I also delve into studying the antecedents and consequences associated with firms’ non-financial decisions, such as firm political alignment with the government’s agenda and the selection of ESG disclosure venues. I aim to use under-explored data to conduct research that provides insights for shareholders and policymakers, shedding light on the potential consequences of various corporate decisions.
 
I am on the <strong >2023-2024 academic job market </strong>. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.
