Welcome to my website! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/thought-leadership/divisions/accounting-information-systems">Accounting and Information System Division</a> of The University of British Columbia. Prior to joining UBC, I obtained my Bachelor in Economics from <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn/">Wuhan University</a> and Master of Finance from <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/">MIT Sloan School of Management</a>.
 
My research interest lies at the intersection of management accounting, ESG, and supply chain practices. I mainly use archival methods to explore how firms make sourcing decisions in relation to climate concerns and boardroom diversity. Additionally, I study the antecedents and consequences associated with firmsâ€™ non-financial decisions, such as firm political alignment and the selection of ESG disclosure venues. I aim to use under-explored data to to offer valuable insights for both shareholders and policymakers on the impact of different corporate actions.
 
I am on the <strong >2023-2024 academic job market </strong>. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.
