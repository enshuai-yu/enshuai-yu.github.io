## Short Bio

Hello, and welcome to my website! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Accounting and Information System Division](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/thought-leadership/divisions/accounting-information-systems) at UBC Sauder School of Business.  

My primary areas of interest lie in healthcare operations management, data analytics, and behavioral queueing. I am passionate about leveraging data-driven methods to facilitate innovative solutions in different healthcare delivery sites, from emergency departments to operating rooms. Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently been engaged in the development and application of empirical, optimization, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex healthcare datasets. My objective is to harness these tools to enhance both the efficacy and quality of healthcare delivery and to generate meaningful insights that can inform policy and decision-making. My research has been acknowledged with the [2023 POMS College of Healthcare Operations Management Best Paper Award](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/xin-david-ding-5b5b618_conference-education-poms-activity-7067906007045156864-xIVs?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). I am also interested in supply chain management and open to other fields in operations management. 

I am currently on the 2023-2024 academic job market.
