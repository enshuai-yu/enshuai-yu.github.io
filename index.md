## About Me

Hello, and welcome to my website! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate actively **on the 2023-2024 job market**. My primary areas of interest lie in healthcare analytics and empirical healthcare operations, and I am passionate about leveraging data-driven methods to facilitate innovative solutions in different healthcare delivery sites, from emergency departments to operating rooms. Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently been engaged in the development and application of empirical and machine learning techniques to analyze complex healthcare datasets. My objective is to harness these tools to enhance the efficacy of healthcare delivery and to generate meaningful insights that can inform policy and decision-making. I invite you to explore my website to learn more about my research and teaching. My CV can be found [here](assets/files/yiwen_cv.pdf).
