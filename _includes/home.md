<br> Short Bio   </h2>

Welcome to my website! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Accounting at UBC Sauder School of Business. I am fortunate to be supervised by Kai Li, Russell Lundholm, Jenny Li Zhang (Chair), and Xin Zheng.  
 
<strong>Research interests:</strong> archival-based studies in managerial accounting and corporate governance - with special focuses on ESG, supply chain management, political costs, executive compensation, non-financial disclosure, etc. 

Prior to joining UBC, I obtained my Master of Finance from MIT Sloan School of Management, and the Bachelor in Economics from Wuhan University. 

I am actively on the <strong >2023-2024 academic job market </strong>. Please feel free to reach out and connect!
