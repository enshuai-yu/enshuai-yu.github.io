<br> Short Bio   </h2>

Welcome to my website! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/thought-leadership/divisions/accounting-information-systems">Accounting and Information System Division</a> of Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia. Prior to joining UBC, I obtained my Bachelor in Economics from Wuhan University and Master of Finance from MIT Sloan School of Management.
 
I primarily use archival methods to explore topics in managerial accounting, ESG, and corporate governance. I am on the <strong >2023-2024 academic job market </strong>. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.
