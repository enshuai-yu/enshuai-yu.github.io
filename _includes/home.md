<br> Short Bio   </h2>

Welcome to my website! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/thought-leadership/divisions/accounting-information-systems">Accounting and Information System Division</a> of UBC Sauder School of Business. Prior to joining UBC, I obtained my Master of Finance from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Bachelor in Economics from Wuhan University.
 
I primarily use archival methods to explore topics in managerial accounting, ESG, and corporate governance, including executive compensation, supply chain management, political costs, non-financial disclosure, etc. I am available for interviews on the <strong >2023-2024 academic job market </strong>. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.
