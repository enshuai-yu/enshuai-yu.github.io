<h2 id="bio" style="margin-top: 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

Welcome! I am Enshuai (pronounced "En-Shwhy"), a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in accounting at <a href="https://www.bc.edu/csom">Carroll School of Management, Boston College</a>. I am a Deloitte Foundation Doctoral Fellowship recipient.

My research interests broadly lie in the intersection of inter-firm contracting (e.g., supply chains), regulation and governance, information disclosure, and taxation. I have been invited to present my research at regulatory agencies (e.g., the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), universities, and numerous conferences.

Before joining BC Carroll's Ph.D. program, I earned a Master's degree in Finance from <a href="https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance at Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, and dual Bachelor's degrees in Accounting and Psychology from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>.

Outside of academics, I enjoy photography, traveling, running (Half Marathon, 10KÃ—2), hiking, concerts, and playing with Pan Pan (A Golden British Shorthair).
