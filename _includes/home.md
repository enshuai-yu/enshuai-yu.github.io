<h2 id="bio" style="margin-top: 60px;">Short Bio</h2>

Welcome! I am Enshuai (pronounced "En-Shwhy"), a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in accounting at Carroll School of Management, Boston College. Prior to joining BC Carroll's Ph.D. program, I received a master's degree in finance from Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and bachelor's degrees in accounting and psychology (dual degree) from Peking University. I am the Deloitte Foundation Doctoral Fellowship recipient.

My research interests broadly lie in the intersection of inter-firm contracting, regulation and governance, information disclosure, and taxation. Specifically, I am interested in economic consequences, especially real effects, of disclosure and governance mechanisms (e.g., disclosure regulation, media), as well as tax-driven incentives. I have been invited to present my research at regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as at universities and numerous conferences.

Outside of academics, I enjoy photography, traveling, running (Boston Half Marathon, Boston 10K Ã— 2), hiking, fitness training, and playing with Pan Pan (A Golden British Shorthair).
