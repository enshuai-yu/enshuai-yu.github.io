<br> Short Bio   </h2>

Welcome to my website! 

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/thought-leadership/divisions/accounting-information-systems">Accounting and Information System Division</a> of UBC Sauder School of Business. I am actively on the <strong >2023-2024 academic job market </strong>.  
 
My research focuses on using archival methods to explore topics in managerial accounting, ESG, and corporate governance, including executive compensation, supply chain management, political costs, non-financial disclosure, etc. 

Prior to joining UBC, I obtained my Master of Finance from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Bachelor in Economics from Wuhan University. Please feel free to reach out and connect!
