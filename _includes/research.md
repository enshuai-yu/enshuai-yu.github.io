  <summary>Abstract</summary>
This study documents a positive and significant association between a firm’s use of climate-linked metrics in executive pay and its outsourced emissions to the supply chain. Using a sample of 870 listed U.S. firms, I find that firms with better internal corporate governance, better financial performance, and lower growth opportunities are more likely to use climate-linked pay. Such pay schemes are followed by an increase in upstream suppliers’ emissions, and a decrease in firms’ direct emissions. This effect is more pronounced among firms with greater climate pressure, greater bargaining power over suppliers, and lower external monitoring. To explore potential mechanisms, I show that firms with climate-linked pay facilitate emissions outsourcing by initiating (terminating) fewer (more) contracts with suppliers from regions with higher emissions costs. Overall, my findings highlight the potential impact of climate-linked metrics in executive compensation on the supply chain.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We examine the determinants and consequences of an important but understudied strategy in managing political risks—firm political alignment (FPA). Using a GPT large language model, we measure FPA as the extent to which firms align their actions with government agendas as presented in annual reports. We argue that FPA increases firm legitimacy in the eyes of the government, thus mitigating political risks. We leverage two political events in China to test our hypotheses. First, as the anti-corruption campaign that started in 2012 and spread across different provinces over time serves as a staggered shock that reduces the effectiveness of political ties, we find that firms respond by increasing their FPA. Second, we find that the announcement of the common prosperity policy in August 2021 sharply increases policy uncertainty for non-SOEs. However, the extent of FPA largely mitigates the negative market reaction. Overall, our evidence suggests that firms resort to FPA as a means of mitigating political risk when the efficacy of political ties is weakened, and FPA is an effective corporate strategy for buffering against political risk.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We examine the determinants and consequences of firms’ choice between two venues for voluntary climate disclosure—corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). We find that a firm’s prior CSR disclosure is positively associated with its CDP disclosure, but not vice versa. Firms with prior CSR disclosure are less likely to disclose via the CDP when they have more climate-related shareholder resolutions, greater carbon impact, and tighter financial constraints. Following the CDP disclosure initiation, firms experience higher liquidity, ESG ratings, analyst coverage, and lower emissions–although these findings apply only to firms without prior CSR disclosure. Overall, our results point to a hitherto overlooked strategic angle in the choice of voluntary climate disclosure by firms.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
We examine whether and how board ethnic diversity shapes the supply chain structure of firms. Leveraging a California bill as an exogenous shock, we show that greater board ethnic diversity leads to a more diversified supply chain. Such diversification is primarily driven by greater information accessibility to upstream suppliers and heightened risk aversion. We find that firms with ethnically diverse boards seek suppliers from similar cultural origins and achieve more efficient inventory performance. Additionally, the associations between board ethnic diversity and supply chain diversification are more pronounced in firms with inferior supplier information and elevated supply chain risks.
